# EIP-7702

## Overview

Enhances the functionality of Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) by enabling them to temporarily adopt smart contract capabilities during transaction execution.
Bridges the gap between EOAs and smart contracts, facilitating advanced features without necessitating a complete overhaul of the existing Ethereum infrastructure.

## Ethereum Foundation EIP Documentation 

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702

## Applications

### Batch Transactions

Users can bundle multiple operations into a single transaction, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

### Sponsored Transactions

EOAs can utilize paymaster contracts to cover gas fees, enabling transactions without holding native ETH.

### Advanced Security Features

Incorporation of multi-factor authentication, social recovery mechanisms, and issuance of sub-keys with limited permissions.

### Innovative Use Cases

The ability for EOAs to execute smart contract code opens avenues for creating more dynamic and user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps).
