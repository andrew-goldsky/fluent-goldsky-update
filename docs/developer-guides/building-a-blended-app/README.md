title: Building a Blended App
---

## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to build a blended application on Fluent. 
It combines a Rust smart contract to return value types to a Solidity smart contract.

This setup demonstrates:

* composability between different programming languages (Solidity and Rust)
* and interoperability between different virtual machine targets (EVM and Wasm)

within a single execution environment.

## Prerequisites

* Rust and Cargo
* Metamask for Remix IDE
* Node.js and npm
