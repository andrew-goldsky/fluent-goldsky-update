## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to build a blended application on Fluent. 
It combines a Rust smart contract to return value types to a Solidity smart contract.

This setup demonstrates:

* composability between different programming languages (Solidity and Rust)
* and interoperability between different virtual machine targets (EVM and Wasm)

within a single execution environment.
